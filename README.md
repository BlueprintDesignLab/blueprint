**Stop fighting with AI coding assistants. Start building with confidence.**

Current AI tools work great for small tasks, but break down on complex projects. They don't understand how different parts of your codebase fit together, leading to:
- Hours lost fixing integration bugs
- AI overwriting carefully written code  
- Chaotic collaboration between team members and AI

Blueprint Design AI solves this by making software architecture explicit and machine-readable. Humans and AI collaborate on a shared plan, generate a visual architecture graph, then develop components independently with clear boundaries.

**The result?** AI that actually understands your system, respects your code boundaries, and helps you ship faster without the integration nightmares.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download the desktop app** from [releases](https://github.com/BlueprintDesignLab/blueprint/releases)
2. **Create your first project** with our starter template
3. **Collaborate with AI** on planning and architecture
4. **Develop with confidence** knowing AI won't break your integrations

## 🎯 Key Features

### 📋 Shared Planning
- Collaborative plan.md file that both humans and AI understand
- No more miscommunication about requirements

### 🗺️ Visual Architecture  
- Generate architecture graphs from your plan
- Clear component boundaries and communication paths
- Both humans and AI can read and edit the structure

### 🛡️ Controlled Development
- Work on individual components independently
- Lock handwritten code from AI modification
- AI respects your architecture contracts

### 🤖 AI That Understands Context
- AI works within defined architectural boundaries
- Natural context window management per component
- Predictable, safe collaboration

## 📦 Getting Started

1. Download from releases
2. Install the desktop app
3. Try the todo-app template

## 🌟 Why Developers Love This

> "Finally an AI tool that doesn't break my code. I can actually delegate real work instead of just simple functions."  
> — Early Beta User

> "The architecture graph makes team collaboration so much clearer. No more guessing what connects to what."  
> — Platform Engineering Lead

## 📚 Documentation

- [Design System](docs/design-system.md)

## 🚧 Current Status

⚠️ **Alpha Release** - We're actively building and want your feedback!

- [x] Basic plan → architecture workflow  
- [x] Component isolation
- [ ] Template system
- [ ] Advanced AI collaboration features
- [ ] Team collaboration tools

We also do not support existing projects as they violate the design system and 
there is no reliable way to refactor away technical debt, however, we may support
this in the future.
