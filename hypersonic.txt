I want to create an intelligent audio manager that runs in parallel with DAWs. 
main goal of the app is to troubleshoot latency issues by running its own audio 
engine which hardware signals can connect to. Since plugins introduce latency 
when musicians use software emulated sounds when playing their keyboard etc. 
Then itâ€™ll intelligently select the best drivers and optimal buffer size for 
each input as well as display the CPU usage. 

Then plugins can be applied to the signal before being output into DAWs for musicians 
normal workflow. Pick the best technology in terms of ease and your expertise and 
justify your design choices.

It needs to run on all OS.
