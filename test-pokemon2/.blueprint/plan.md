# Project Overview

## Objective
Build a browser-based, Pokémon-style game aimed at nostalgic adults. Key features include creature collection, turn-based battles, world exploration, and online multiplayer modes (trading, PvP battles), using freely available online art assets.

## Core Functionalities
- Creature (monster) collection and management
- Exploration of a game world (map-based movement)
- Turn-based battle system (PvE and PvP)
- Multiplayer features: real-time trading, online turn-based PvP battles
- User authentication and account management
- Inventory and item usage

# Requirements & Specifications

## Functional Requirements
- Users can create an account and log in/out (via Firebase Authentication)
- Players can explore a 2D overworld and encounter wild creatures
- Players can capture, train, and manage a collection of creatures
- Turn-based battle system with AI and other online players
- Real-time matchmaking and PvP battles using turn-based mechanics
- Item collection, inventory management, and usage in/between battles
- Trade creatures and items with other players online
- Responsive browser-based UI (desktop and mobile)
- Use of free, online graphics assets

## Non-functional Requirements
- Secure user data and fair gameplay (anti-cheat mechanisms)
- Persistent storage for player progress, inventory, and collections (via Firestore)
- Scalable multiplayer backend supporting concurrent sessions
- Fast load times and smooth user experience
- Modular, maintainable codebase following best practices

## User Personas/Stories
- **Nostalgic Adult Player:** Wants to relive classic monster-catching and battling experiences with modern multiplayer convenience.
- **Competitive Player:** Focused on perfecting strategies and participating in online battles.
- **Social Player:** Enjoys trading creatures and interacting with the game community.
- **Explorer:** Interested in uncovering secrets and discovering new creatures across a vast map.

# Technology Stack & Tools

## Frontend
- **Phaser**: 2D browser game engine for rendering, animation, and game logic
- **JavaScript (ES6+) / TypeScript**: Main scripting language(s)
- **Responsive UI frameworks** (e.g., Tailwind CSS or custom CSS) for overlays and menus

## Backend / Cloud Services
- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment (for custom game logic, matchmaking, multiplayer events)
- **Socket.IO**: Real-time communication for multiplayer features
- **Express.js**: REST API for any server-side logic not handled by Firebase
- **Firebase Firestore**: NoSQL cloud database for storing user profiles, collections, persistent progress, inventory, battles, trades
- **Firebase Authentication**: User account management and secure authentication

## Asset Management
- Free/open-source sprite and tile asset repositories (e.g., OpenGameArt, itch.io assets)

## Rationale
- **Phaser** provides robust, flexible 2D game tools and integrates well with online multiplayer setups
- **Node.js + Socket.IO** offers reliable, scalable, real-time communication suited to turn-based multiplayer games
- **Firebase (Firestore & Auth)** delivers scalable, real-time data storage and seamless authentication, reducing infrastructure overhead
- **Open-source assets** keep costs low and speed up development
