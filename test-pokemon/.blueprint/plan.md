# Project Overview

## Brief Description
A browser-based, retro pixel art adventure game inspired by Pok√©mon, built with Phaser.js and TypeScript. The game features a single 2D tile-based overworld, random wild encounters, turn-based battles, a party/collection system for up to 5 unique creatures, and persistent save data using browser localStorage. The codebase is modular, idiomatic TypeScript, leveraging Phaser.js for rendering, input, and scene management. Placeholder pixel art assets are acceptable.

## Core Functionalities
- 2D top-down overworld exploration with keyboard controls
- Single tile-based map/area
- Random wild encounters in tall grass
- Turn-based battles (use moves, view stats, catch creatures)
- 5 unique collectible creatures
- Basic party/collection screenfewf
- Single save file using browser localStorage
- Retro pixel art style (placeholder assets acceptable)
- Modular, idiomatic TypeScript codebase
- Phaser.js for rendering, input, and scene management lolols

# Requirements & Specifications

## Functional Requirements
- FR1: Player can move a character around a 2D tile-based overworld using keyboard input.
- FR2: Random wild encounters can occur when walking through tall grass tiles.
- FR3: Battles are turn-based, allowing the player to use moves, view stats, and attempt to catch wild creatures.
- FR4: Player can catch up to 5 unique creatures and view them in a party/collection screen.
- FR5: Game state (player position, party, progress) is saved and loaded from browser localStorage.
- FR6: Game uses retro pixel art style for all visuals (placeholder art acceptable).
- FR7: Codebase is modular and idiomatic TypeScript, using Phaser.js for all game logic.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: P95 < 200 ms
- Availability: 99.9% monthly
- Security: Local-only, no authentication required for MVP (OAuth2/GDPR reserved for future expansion)

## User Personas / Stories
- UJ1: As a player, I want to explore the overworld and discover wild creatures, so I experience a sense of adventure and discovery.
- UJ2: As a player, I want to engage in turn-based battles with wild creatures, so I can test strategy and try to catch new creatures.
- UJ3: As a player, I want to view and manage collected creatures in a party screen, so I can track progress and plan future battles.
- UJ4: As a player, I want to save and resume progress, so I can continue my adventure without losing progress.

# Technology Stack & Tools

## Programming Languages & Frameworks
- TypeScript: Strong typing, maintainability, and modern JS features
- Phaser.js: 2D game rendering, input, and scene management

## Infrastructure & Tooling
- Browser-based (no backend required)
- localStorage for persistence
- NPM/Yarn for dependency management
- Webpack/Vite for bundling
- GitHub for version control

## Rationale
- Phaser.js is a mature, well-documented HTML5 game framework ideal for 2D games.
- TypeScript ensures code quality and maintainability.
- Browser-based deployment maximizes accessibility and ease of sharing.

# Implementation Roadmap

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Core Systems
- Set up TypeScript + Phaser.js project scaffold
- Configure build tooling (Webpack/Vite)
- Implement tile-based map rendering and player movement
- Placeholder pixel art assets and map data

## Phase 2: Overworld & Encounters
- Implement tall grass detection and random encounter logic
- Create basic UI for player stats and notifications

## Phase 3: Battle System
- Implement turn-based battle scene
- Add move selection, stat display, and catch mechanic
- Create 5 unique creatures with basic stats and moves

## Phase 4: Party/Collection & Persistence
- Implement party/collection screen
- Add localStorage save/load logic for player state, party, and progress

## Phase 5: Polish & Testing
- Refine UI/UX (menus, health bars, dialog boxes)
- Add basic retro sound effects (optional, if time permits)
- Manual playtesting and bugfixing
- Prepare for deployment (e.g., GitHub Pages)

### Estimated Timelines
- Each phase: 1 week (total 5 weeks for MVP, solo developer)

# Resource & Risk Management

## Recommended Resources
- Solo developer with TypeScript and Phaser.js experience
- Optional: Pixel artist for improved assets (future)

## Potential Risks & Mitigations
- Scope creep: Stick to single map, 5 creatures, and basic features for MVP
- Asset quality: Use placeholder art, plan for future replacement
- Performance: Optimize tilemap and battle logic for smooth gameplay
- Persistence bugs: Thoroughly test save/load logic

# Validation & Deployment Strategy

## Testing Approach
- Manual playtesting for all user journeys
- Unit tests for core logic (optional, if time permits)

## Deployment Strategy
- Deploy static build to GitHub Pages or Netlify
- Use version control (GitHub)

## Maintenance & Scaling
- Modular codebase for easy feature expansion
- Asset pipeline for future art upgrades
- Plan for future authentication and compliance if multiplayer or user accounts are added
